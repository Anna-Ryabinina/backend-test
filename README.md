# backend-test
Test assignment for Aircall

Tests are written using [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) lib and [jestjs](https://jestjs.io/en/)

### Setup

In project folder run
> npm i

To run tests you have to use your API_ID and API_TOKEN. 

(I didn't put my api credentials anywhere in the code for security purpose). 

Command to run tests: 
> API_ID=[api_id] API_TOKEN=[api_token] npm test
